## Bio

I am ZHAO Yongwei(赵永威), a postgrad student at [Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ict.ac.cn). My advisor is [Prof. XU Zhiwei](http://novel.ict.ac.cn/zxu/). Starting from 2015, I joined the research group of intelligence processor, led by [Prof. CHEN Yunji](http://novel.ict.ac.cn/ychen) and [Prof. CHEN Tianshi](http://novel.ict.ac.cn/tchen). I have served as a software engineer in [Cambricon](http://www.cambricon.com) for several years, and returned to scientific research in 2018.

Furthermore, I was widely known as "Aean" in World of Warcraft communities as a theorycrafter. The name is abbreviated from "Aeanderine", which is one of my role-playing character in the game. I have contributed many theories, simulators and game guides to the community, mostly published at [National Geography of Azeroth](http://bbs.nga.cn/nuke.php?func=ucp&uid=9771319). I did my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://www.hust.edu.cn) during 2011 ~ 2015. Regardless of people's prejudice, I presented my theory about game policy optimizing as my undergraduate thesis, since I believe it is the genuine work which I have dedicated to for several years. Today I am trying to take advantages of my prior works, to solve problems in formal analysis of systems and algorithms.

My interests are including computer architectures, and artificial intelligence in game. Benefit from the experience of IreCore, I have a strong ability of building extremely fast simulators to implement a quick model of my work or to re-implement other's works, which has been a significant advantage for my research.

## Engineering

I am one of the two leading coders of the closed-source project *NGPF*, the compiler backend of Cambricon products. The project was started in September 2016 with my partner WANG Yuqing. We cooperated the first system design and implemented it in 3 months. WANG left the project group in June 2017 thus I took on the system design since then. I left the group in mid-2018, by the time when the project group has grown to 60+ engineers and independently became a new department of Cambricon Ltd. The system is still shipping with newest products, running on 1,000,000+ Huawei smartphones.

## Research

I have just finished my first research work *Fractal Machine Learning Computers*, which has been accepted by [ISCA 2019](https://iscaconf.org/isca2019/).

## Legacy Projects

I always create pet projects for my own inspiration, and feels happy to share them with you. These pets were built earlier but still memorable for me:

* 2016 - [IreCore 2](https://github.com/AeanSR/irecore2), a refreshed implement for IreCore.
* 2015 - [IreCore](https://sim.aean.net), a high performance WoW simulator (~20x faster than [SimC](https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc)).
* 2015 - [EAGA](https://github.com/AeanSR/eaga)(Enhanced APLGA), a better implement for APLGA. This is part of my undergrad thesis.
* 2014 - [APLGA](https://github.com/AeanSR/aplga)(Action Priority List Genetic Algorithm), an algorithm to find optimal policy for WoW damage dealers.
* 2014 - [KalScope](http://aean.net/kalscope), a gomoku AI.

## About my pages...

This blog is not for academic or serious things. I don't want to be so serious...

It is just a memo or portfolio for my thoughts and works, sometimes even a common diary.
