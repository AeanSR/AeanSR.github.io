## Bio

I am ZHAO Yongwei (赵永威). I recieved Ph.D. degree from [Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ict.ac.cn) in 2020. My advisor is [Prof. XU Zhiwei](http://novel.ict.ac.cn/zxu/), and [Prof. CHEN Yunji](http://novel.ict.ac.cn/ychen) in common. Starting from 2015, I joined the research group of intelligence processor, led by [Prof. CHEN Yunji](http://novel.ict.ac.cn/ychen) and [Prof. CHEN Tianshi](http://novel.ict.ac.cn/tchen). I am one of the two winners of the Special Scholarship of the Director, ICT (the XIA Peisu Scholarship), in 2019, one of the winners of the Excellent Scholarship of the President, CAS, in 2020, and selected for the Special Research Assistant Funding Project in 2020.

Today I am an assistant professor at ICT, CAS. My research interests are including accelerator architectures and neural-symbolic system.

## Engineering

I have also served as a software engineer and architect in [Cambricon](http://www.cambricon.com) for several years. I am one of the two leading coders of the closed-source project *NGPF*, the compiler backend of Cambricon products. The project was started in September 2016 with my partner WANG Yuqing. We cooperated the first project design and implemented it in 3 months. WANG left the project group in June 2017 thus I took on the project design since then. I left the group in mid-2018, by the time when the project group has grown to 60+ engineers and independently became a new department of Cambricon Ltd.

The project is still shipping with the newest products. This project was shipped with Huawei Kirin 970/980 processors. If you have a Mate10 / Mate20 phone, there are my code running in the background :D

## As a Theorycrafter

Until I joined a real research group, I was widely known as "Aean" (abbreviated from "Aeanderine", one of my role-playing character) in World of Warcraft communities as a theorycrafter (scientists gamer). I have contributed many theories, simulators, game-guides to the community, mostly published at the [National Geography of Azeroth](http://bbs.nga.cn/nuke.php?func=ucp&uid=9771319). I did my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://www.hust.edu.cn) during 2011 ~ 2015 and presented my theory about game policy optimizing as my undergraduate thesis.

Today I am trying to take advantages of my prior experiences to solve problems in the real science fields.

## Legacy Projects

I always create hobby projects for my own inspiration and feel happy to share them with you. These pets were built far earlier but still memorable for me:

* 2016 - [IreCore 2](https://github.com/AeanSR/irecore2), a refreshed implement for IreCore.
* 2015 - [IreCore](https://sim.aean.net), a high performance WoW simulator (~20x faster than [SimC](https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc)).
* 2015 - [EAGA](https://github.com/AeanSR/eaga)(Enhanced APLGA), a better implement for APLGA. This is part of my undergrad thesis.
* 2014 - [APLGA](https://github.com/AeanSR/aplga)(Action Priority List Genetic Algorithm), an algorithm to find the optimal policy for WoW damage dealers.
* 2014 - [KalScope](http://aean.net/kalscope), a Gomoku AI.
