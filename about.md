## Bio

I am ZHAO Yongwei (赵永威). I recieved Ph.D. degree from [Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ict.ac.cn) in 2020. My advisor is [Prof. XU Zhiwei](http://novel.ict.ac.cn/zxu/), and [Prof. CHEN Yunji](http://novel.ict.ac.cn/ychen) in common. Starting from 2015, I joined the research group of intelligence processor, led by [Prof. CHEN Yunji](http://novel.ict.ac.cn/ychen) and [Prof. CHEN Tianshi](http://novel.ict.ac.cn/tchen). I have also served as a software engineer in [Cambricon](http://www.cambricon.com) for several years.

Today I am an assistant professor of ICT, CAS. My research interests are including accelerator architectures and neural-symbolic system.

## Engineering

I am one of the two leading coders of the closed-source project *NGPF*, the compiler backend of Cambricon products. The project was started in September 2016 with my partner WANG Yuqing. We cooperated the first project design and implemented it in 3 months. WANG left the project group in June 2017 thus I took on the project design since then. I left the group in mid-2018, by the time when the project group has grown to 60+ engineers and independently became a new department of Cambricon Ltd.

The project is still shipping with the newest products. This project was shipped with Huawei Kirin 970/980 processors. If you have a Mate10 / Mate20 phone, there are my code running in the background :D

## As a Theorycrafter

Until I joined a real research group, I was widely known as "Aean" (abbreviated from "Aeanderine", one of my role-playing character) in World of Warcraft communities as a theorycrafter (scientists gamer). I have contributed many theories, simulators, game-guides to the community, mostly published at the [National Geography of Azeroth](http://bbs.nga.cn/nuke.php?func=ucp&uid=9771319). I did my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://www.hust.edu.cn) during 2011 ~ 2015 and presented my theory about game policy optimizing as my undergraduate thesis.

Today I am trying to take advantages of my prior experiences to solve problems in the real science fields.

## Legacy Projects

I always create pet projects for my own inspiration and feel happy to share them with you. These pets were built earlier but still memorable for me:

* 2016 - [IreCore 2](https://github.com/AeanSR/irecore2), a refreshed implement for IreCore.
* 2015 - [IreCore](https://sim.aean.net), a high performance WoW simulator (~20x faster than [SimC](https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc)).
* 2015 - [EAGA](https://github.com/AeanSR/eaga)(Enhanced APLGA), a better implement for APLGA. This is part of my undergrad thesis.
* 2014 - [APLGA](https://github.com/AeanSR/aplga)(Action Priority List Genetic Algorithm), an algorithm to find the optimal policy for WoW damage dealers.
* 2014 - [KalScope](http://aean.net/kalscope), a Gomoku AI.
