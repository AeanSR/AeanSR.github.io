## Bio

I am ZHAO Yongwei(赵永威), a first year grad student at [Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ict.ac.cn). My advisor is [Prof. Zhiwei Xu](http://novel.ict.ac.cn/zxu/).

Furthermore, I am widely known as "Aean" in World of Warcraft communities as a theorycrafter. "Aean" is my role-playing character in the game. I stopped my journey in WoW for pretty long time, but still contribute my theory, simulator and game guides to the community.

I am just a beginner of science research. I did my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://www.hust.edu.cn) during 2011 ~ 2015. Regardless of people's prejudice, I presented my theory about game policy optimizing as my undergraduate thesis, since I believe it is the genuine work which I have dedicated to it for several years. Today I am trying to take advantages of my prior works, to solve problems in formal analysis of systems and algorithms.

My interests are including computer architectures, monte-carlo simulation, and artificial intelligence in game.

## Projects

I always create pet projects for my own inspiration, and feels happy to share them with you. I am currently aiming at these projects:

* 2016 - [IreCore 2](https://github.com/AeanSR/irecore2), a refreshed implement for IreCore.

Something I built earlier, and still thinks as meaningful or memorable:

* 2015 - [IreCore](https://sim.aean.net), a high performance WoW simulator (~20x faster than [SimC](https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc)).
* 2015 - [EAGA](https://github.com/AeanSR/eaga)(Enhanced APLGA), a better implement for APLGA. This is part of my undergrad thesis.
* 2014 - [APLGA](https://github.com/AeanSR/aplga)(Action Priority List Genetic Algorithm), an algorithm to find optimal policy for WoW damage dealers.
* 2014 - [KalScope](http://aean.net/kalscope), a gomoku AI.
