Found a simple & generic way to translate programs into RTL. This used to be one of the hardest problem in my thought several years ago.

I came to this solution independently in Apirl 2016, only known Xilinx/Altera have solved it recently. Unfortunately, many people have found and implemented this decades ago.

If you are looking for ideas about it, this example may help: [c2hdl](https://aean.net/ext/c2hdl.pdf).
