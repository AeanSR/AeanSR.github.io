title: Diannaar Greedies (Original Composing)
---

This is my second original composing. In fact the motif (together with the first half score) forms even earlier than the previous one (Emviala), it was my counter-point exercise.
Only after that I realized that I cannot modulates or use chromatic notes yet. Then I started to work on Emviala, where I try my best to be chromatic.

In Oct. 1st 2020 the national day, I filled the second half score (which simply modulates to A maj). This sounds great! ~What an innocent sound...~
