title: Emviala Moira (Original Piano Composing)
---

I finished my first original composing during the COVID-19 outbreak. It took 2 years from when I formed the motif (15-#45-.), but still not well polished though, sounds incoherent (specially in the first section).

I wish I could be enough experienced in the next year, to come to a qualified edition to publish. 

Critical comments are really appreciated.
