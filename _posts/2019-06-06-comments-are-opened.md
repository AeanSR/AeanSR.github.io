title: Comments are Opened!
---

As we all know, Jekyll is a static page building system. My blog lost the ability to recieve comments since I abbandoned Wordpress. And finally, it is back!

I have implemented a simple comment board with iframes. The backend is hosted on [Server Nighthaven](https://nighthaven.aean.net). [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) is used to show avatar according to email, and [Akismet](https://akismet.com/) is used to filter spams.

I have little knowledge of building a stylesheet for pages so it looks a little bit ... shoddy.

Try it out.
