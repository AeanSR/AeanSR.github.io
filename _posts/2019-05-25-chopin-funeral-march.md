title: Chopin Funeral March

I upgraded my piano to a Dexibell VIVO P7 recently. The more realistic keyboard action of the new piano is harder to control, and out of my level though.

I have made a bunch of mistakes in this recording, but it still sounds ok to me, so I just published it as is.

<div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;background-color: black;height:0;"><iframe src="//player.bilibili.com/player.html?aid=53556513&cid=93686838&page=1" scrolling="no" border="0" frameborder="no" framespacing="0" allowfullscreen="true" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0; height: 100%; width: 100%;"> </iframe>
</div>
